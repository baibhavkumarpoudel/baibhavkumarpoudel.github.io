I believe Flexbox was a vital part of my project.

It helped me organize my boxes the way I wanted to.

I googled lots of css picture width/height, hyperlink customs, <ul> tags info, border designs etc. 

I utilized media screen to adjust when screen is smaller in size. 

I included two pictures which were located inside the same folder as index.html and main.css


Before starting to write the html and css code, I sketched a rough design (more like boxes) on a piece of paper to help me visualize the ultimate goal.
